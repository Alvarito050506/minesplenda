terrible bot written for splenda to handle some admin stuff in vanilla minecraft

the crappy idea:
lower level admins on the server dont get op, but get permission to chat with this bot. by sending messages to bot, bot will react by running whatever command.
current idea is to have the bot present in discord, and react to messages in an admin only room. 

my code is also crap
