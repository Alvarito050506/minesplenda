terrible bot written for splenda to handle some admin stuff in vanilla minecraft

the crappy idea:
lower level admins on the server dont get op, but get permission to chat with this bot. by sending messages to bot, bot will react by running whatever command.
current idea is to have the bot present in discord, and react to messages in an admin only room. 

my code is also crap

what acutally ended up being written:
uses mcchat2 to communicate with the server. bot passes messages to stdin of the mcchat process
level of permisions based on user roles in discord
thanks to Alvarito050506 for cleanup and making my spaghetti code much less spaghetti-like

how to use:
if youre crazy enough to use this yourself, i didn't make it easy, but i didnt make it intenitonally hard.

clone repo
npm install discord.js
have a copy of mcchat2 in ../src/mcchat2/ (or edit the line with that)
change server, email, and pass in the this.mcchatProc line
replace token with discord bot token at last line
node minesplenda.js
cross fingers?
